Another year and another trip to Centerparcs. This time it was with all of Anna’s family.
Very cold weather and we even woke up to a reasonable sprinkling of snow on the final day, but for the most part it was dry.
Each day revolved round a trip to the sub tropical paradise of the dome. We spent a good couple of hours in there each day and Anna’s Sisters and their families went to the pool twice in the day, but for Dylan once a day was enough to exhaust him.
The time in the pool gave me a chance to take my new GoPro for a test run. The video that I’ve made was all in the pool and all from the GoPro.
