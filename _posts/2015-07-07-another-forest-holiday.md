We loved our first trip of the year to Centerparcs that we went again in the summer.
The weather hit the mid-30s which meant a lot of pool time to cool down, but we also got out on our bikes, did a bit of exploring in the forest, had an archery session and made a cuddly tiger in a space suit, naturally!
