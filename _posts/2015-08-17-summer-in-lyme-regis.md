A mixed week weather wise meant we had some days on the beach in Lyme Regis, and also visited Seaton and Dorchester on the not-so-sunny days. The last day of the week was very wet and we had booked a fossil walk at Charmouth, so the rain made little difference once we got stuck in to the 190 million year old rocks.
