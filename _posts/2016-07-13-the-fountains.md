Another birthday, another day out.
This time was a visit to Londons South Bank and outside the Royal Festival Hall, the fountains provided an opportunity for the cousins to play in the water.
It was a hot day, and the fountains themselves are much more fierce than they look, and pretty chilly too which I can certainly confirm given that I was one of the few adults who braved them.
