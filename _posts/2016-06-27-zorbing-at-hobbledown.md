A couple of family birthdays and Fathers Day were celebrated at Hobbledown.

There were loads of us, and there were plenty of activities to keep the children busy, however it was the Zorbs that seemed to be the biggest hit of the day.

Unfortunately I had to disappear early but still had enough time to get some video.
